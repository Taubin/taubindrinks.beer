    This week, the homebrewing community lost a prominent member. Paul Wicksteed, know by a lot of people as Time4Another1  passed away. Paul's passing has been very shocking for all of us. My thoughts and prayers go out to Paul's family and friends. The wounds will heal, even if they never go away. I hope wherever Paul is, the beer is some of the best he's ever had. Rest in Peace friend, for now, it's Time4Another1 in your honor.
